# Dogecoin Cryptocurrency Analysis

üìñ **Project Overview**
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Dogecoin (DOGE), focusing on historical price trends, volatility patterns, and predictive modeling using both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches.  

üéØ **Project Objectives**
Collect and preprocess historical Dogecoin price data

Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns

Develop predictive models for short-term price forecasting

Compare Dogecoin's performance against major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum)

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

üìä **Data Sources**
Price Data: Historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Ethereum from Yahoo Finance 

Technical Indicators: Calculated from price data (moving averages,trading volumes,volatility and daily returns etc.)

üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Stack**
Programming Language: Python 

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random forest

Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras (LSTM)

Data Collection: yfinance

üìà **Project Workflow**
